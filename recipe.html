<p>This <em>creamy</em> dish of pasta in a <em>luxurious</em> sauce of bacon, egg, and cheese is a easy to make treat. Adding lots of <em>good, fresh <strong>black pepper</strong></em> will really add to the brightness of the dish and make the other ingredients "pop."</p>

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1/2 pound bacon, diced</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon garlic, minced</li>
  <li>1 pound pasta, cooked al dente
    <ul>
      <li>The traditional noodle is spaghetti, but linguine also works</li>
      <li>Don't overcook your noodles! They will become mushy.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
  <li>1 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
  <li>Salt and fresh black pepper, to taste</li>
</ul>

  <h2>Directions:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Cook the bacon in a large pan over medium heat until crisp.</li>
  <li>Remove the bacon from the pan, and pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the rendered fat.</li>
  <li>Add the garlic and black pepper to the pan and cook until fragrant, just a minute or so</li>
  <li>Add the bacon and pasta back to the pan and cook for another minute.</li>
  <li>Take the pan off the heat and add the eggs and cheese, stir quickly so the eggs thicken but don't scramble</li>
</ol>
