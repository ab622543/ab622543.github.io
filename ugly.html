Poems by Lewis Carrol

Jabberwocky
'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.


<p>'Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Beware the <em>Jubjub</em>
bird, and shun
The frumious Bandersnatch!'</P>

<p>He took his vorpal sword in hand:
Long time the manxome foe he sought --
So rested he by the
Tumtum tree,
And stood a while in thought.</p>

<p>And, as in uffish thought he stood,
The <strong>Jabberwock</strong>, with eyes of flame,
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
And burbled as it came!</p>

<p>One two! One two! And through and through
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its head
He went galumphing back.</p>

<p>'And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
Come to my arms,
my beamish boy!
Oh frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'
He chortled in his joy.</p>

<p>'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.</p>

<p>The Walrus and the Carpenter
The sun was shining on the sea,
Shining with all his might:
He did his very best to make
The <strong>billows smooth</strong> and bright --
And this was odd, because it was
The middle of the night.</p>

<p>The moon was shining sulkily,
Because she thought the sun
Had got no business to be there
After
the day was done --
'It's very rude of him.' she said,
'To come and spoil the fun!'</p>

<p>The sea was wet as wet could be,
The sands were dry as dry.
You could not see a cloud, because
No cloud was in the sky:
No birds were flying overhead --
There were no birds to fly.</p>

<p>The Walrus and the Carpenter
Were walking close at hand:
They wept like anything to see
Such quantities of sand:
'If this were only cleared away,'
They said, 'it would be grand.'</p>

<p>'If seven maids with seven mops
Swept it for half a year,
Do you suppose,' the Walrus said,
'That they could get it clear?'
'l doubt it,' said the Carpenter,
And shed a bitter tear.</p>

<p>'O Oysters, come and walk with us!
The Walrus did beseech.
'A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,
Along the briny beach:
We cannot do with more than four,
To give a hand to each.'</p>

<p>The eldest Oyster looked at him,
But never a word he said:
The eldest Oyster winked his eye,
And shook
his heavy head --
Meaning to say he did not choose
To leave the oyster-bed.</p>

<p>Out four young Oysters hurried up.
All eager for the treat:
Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,
Their shoes were clean and neat --
And this was odd, because, you know,
They hadn't any feet.</p>

<p>Four other Oysters followed them,
And yet another four;
And thick and fast they came at last,
And more, and more, and more --
All hopping through the frothy waves,
And scrambling to the shore.</p>

<p>The Walrus and the Carpenter
Walked on a mile or so,
And then they rested on a rock
Conveniently low:
And all the little Oysters stood
And waited in a row.</p>

<p>'The time has come,' the Walrus said,
'To talk of many things:
Of shoes -- and ships -- and sealing wax --
Of cabbages -- and kings --
And why the sea is boiling hot --
And whether pigs have wings.'</p>

<p>'But wait a bit,' the Oysters cried,
'Before we have our chat;
For some of us are out of breath,
And all of us are fat!'
<em>'No hurry!'</em> said the Carpenter.
They thanked him much for that.</p>

<p>'A loaf of bread,' the Walrus said,
<em>'Is what we chiefly need:</em>
Pepper and vinegar besides
Are very good indeed --
Now, if you're ready, Oysters dear,
We can begin to feed.'</p>

<p>'But not on us!' the Oysters cried,
Turning a little blue.
'After such
kindness, that would be
<em>A dismal thing to do!'</em>
'The night is fine,' the Walrus said,
'Do you admire the view?'</p>

<p>'It was so kind of you to come!
<em>And you are very nice!'</em>
The Carpenter said nothing but
'Cut us another slice-
I wish you were not quite so deaf-
I've had to ask you twice!'</p>

<p>'It seems a shame,' the Walrus said,
'To play them such a trick.
After we've brought them out so far,
And made them <em>trot so quick!'</em>
The Carpenter said nothing but
'The butter's spread too thick!'</p>

<p>'I weep for you,'the Walrus said:
'I deeply sympathize.'
With <em>sobs and tears</em> he sorted out
Those of the largest size,
Holding his pocket-handkerchief
Before his streaming eyes.</p>

<p>'O Oysters,' said the Carpenter,
'You've had a pleasant run!
Shall we be trotting home again?'
But answer came there none --
And this was scarcely odd, because
They'd eaten every one.</p>
